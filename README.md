<p>
Go to your agent window and look at your tickets. Generally you want to do your tickets by oldest first but that might change due to other ticket urgency or Lead/Boss has other assignment for you. Communicate as much as possible about wether the ticket was finished,handed off, delayed or the SLA was changed. Communicate back and forth with the customer so their not left wondering.

</p>
<p>
  Change settings on ticket and reassign if necessary to the appropriate teams or groups so the SLA is done on time. The SLA is the length of time to resolve the Ticket. Some tickets are handed off to other agents or teams because of their required permissions.
